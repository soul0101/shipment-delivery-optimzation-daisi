# Shipment Delivery Optimzation Daisi

**_NOTE:_** This daisi aims to demonstrate daisi-chaining and also the parallel executions of expensive daisi calls. 

Consider a scenario where a delivery company wants to deliver packages (__drops__) all across the city with the help of 
fulfillment centres (__depots__) at strategic locations. \n
Each depot has a pre-defined __number of vehicles__ with certain package carrying __capacity__. \n
Our job is to __allocate__ the drops to a service centre and generate __planned routes__ for each vehicle with the objective of __minimizing cost__ (distance travelled).
